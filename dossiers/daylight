 The radio alarm clock crows at the shrillest moment of the morning talk show, 
 breathless cackles, the fallout of a joke about silver and Jews. Shower, 
 coffee, shave. Morning anchor’s face, small, reflected in the bathroom mirror,
 says the wars proceed as expected. Profile on amputee veteran is the foil of 
 degenerate protester caught mid-Marxist-screed. Airline commercial, internatio
 -nal flight, because apparently some people can leave by choice. Breakfast, 
 briefcase, stumble to the bus, bus to the metro, metro to the office. Only two
 security checkpoints today and they seem bored. It almost feels like a Satur
 -day morning. Today is looking to be a good day. Knock on wood.

 The cubicle is off. Roll-O-Index is open to a contact you haven’t called in ag
 -es. Answering machine popped open, cassette missing. Notecards with market le
 -ads are scattered around the floor. Boss greets you, along with Two Freedom 
 Fist soldiers, masked. No baton or shield, just holstered sidearms. “There’s 
 someone who needs to talk to you. Conference room B,” boss says sheepishly. 
 The walk there, a trip maybe 20 seconds going slow, is eternal when flanked on
 both sides in a 9 AM perp walk. Whispers. Gasps. Coworkers gawk, only to turn 
 away quickly when your eyes meet theirs.

 They don’t follow you into the conference room, but stand at attention just 
 outside. A woman, grey pantsuit, square shoulders, librarian glasses, hair in
 bun. She has her hands on a manila envelope, briefcase leaning against her 
 chair. “Take a seat,” she says. You do. She stands up, walks over to the 
 blinds. The entire office is staring back aghast, and with a flick of the 
 wrist, she shuts them out. “You’ll be spending your day in here today,” she 
 says on her way back to her seat. “The men outside will escort you if you need
 to use the bathroom or grab your lunch out of the kitchen.” You steel yourself
 for an interrogation. 
 You’re loyal. You’re a patriot. You have nothing to hide. Why are you here? 
 What could possibly be in that envelope?

 She grabs her briefcase, lays it on the table, opens it, and extracts today’s 
 newspaper. She leans back in her chair and begins to read the newspaper. 
 Minutes pass. “Why am I here?” She says nothing. “I have work to do.” Nothing.
 “What is this about?” Nothing. “Why are you doing this to me?” Nothing. 
 Periodic glances over the top of her newspaper, or the shifting of her glasses.
 Sheer boredom mixed with terror. What do they have? You conjure every call, 
 letter, and contact you can remember. Wince recalling conversations you’ve had.
 What could be construed as anti-government? There is nothing. You can’t think 
 of anything. Why is this happening?

 Bathroom break. When you open the door, the normal buzz of the office goes 
 silent, like the fauna of the forest going still in the absence of a predator.
 Perp walk to the bathroom. It takes heroic willpower to use the urinal with 
 the escort standing behind you. Wash your hands methodically. Collar and 
 armpits stained, beads of sweat dripping from your forehead. Perp walk back to
 the conference room. Hours pass.

 Finally, it’s quarter to 5. No questions asked, no conversation had. You spent
 your day watching her read the newspaper front to back, move on to magazines, 
 file her nails, and yawn. She packs up everything in her briefcase, save for 
 the envelope which hasn’t moved in nearly 8 hours. She stands up and looks at 
 it, acknowledging that she is leaving it behind. “Thank you for your coopera
 -tion,” she says on her way out. “You’re free to go.” She is escorted out by 
 the Freedom Fist and leaves the conference room door open. As soon as you see 
 the elevator doors across the cubicle farm open and close, you rush to the 
 other side of the table and open the envelope. It is empty.

 You slowly walk to your cube. You dip into a friend’s cube and he sort of 
 recoils in his seat, like he’s seen a ghost. You think better of telling him 
 that you spent 8 hours watching someone read a newspaper. Who would believe 
 you? Anyways, happy hour is clearly off. No one says goodbye. No one even walks
 by your cube, despite it being in a major thoroughfare. Boss is glaring at you
 from a distance. You’ve brought something ugly into the office. Few, if any of
 these people are fans of the regime, but they will be damn sure to keep their 
 distance from someone who had just spent a full workday being interrogated. 
 In fact, they’ll be keeping their eyes on you. Remember that one comment he 
 made? Was he really “fishing” on that weeklong fishing trip? Yeah, we did 
 happy hour a lot, but we only ever talked about sports. Let’s take another 
 look at that performance review. I just realized he always turned the channel 
 when the President was on. How much you want to bet that only a few of the 
 calls he was making were to his market leads? He always wants to eat at that 
 Mexican joint. I always knew there was something off about that guy.

 You know the state interrogation is over, but the real inquisition has just 
 begun. The sad part is, you weren’t even the target. It only took eight hours
 and newspaper to recruit an entire office of telemarketers into loyalist agents
