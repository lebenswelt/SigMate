 It was only three nights ago that the entire department decided that Fireteam 
 09 was going to get left on a call. The conversations happened in several 
 places: in the barracks, during patrol, during happy hour. The message was 
 always the same: if 09 was in trouble, you let them rot, or it would be your 
 fireteam that would be left on a call. 09 wasn’t carrying water for the 
 department. They took off their masks and lowered their shields during the 
 Lincoln street demonstration. The protestors lost their minds and walked right
 through the line. The Fist was humiliated on television. All four of these 
 asshole “heroes” needed to go. But nobody thought that their time would come 
 so quickly.

 [Dispatch! This is 09! We’re under fire! The APC took a rocket, we can’t move.
 We need backup!]

 [Copy that, 09. What’s your 20?]

 Three blocks away, Fireteam 08 sat in their APC: Private Able at the wheel, 
 Private Samuel at the radio, and Privates Toddy and Gorman in back. Toddy 
 whooped with excitement when he heard what unit was calling in, declaring it
 “Couldn’t happen to a better bunch of guys! I’m really starting to warm up to
 these insurgents!” The group chuckled along, some more enthusiastically than 
 others. Samuel instinctively reached for the radio, only to catch himself and
 slowly retract his hand.

 “Shit, you hear that?” asked Able, tilting his head towards the window. He 
 heard the rumble of automatic fire. “This is happening right next door. What 
 do you say, guys?”

 [Copy that, 09. All units, are there any fireteams in the area to assist?]

 Gorman in back broke the jubilant tone, and said in a low, steady voice, “This
 is where we gotta’ stay strong, brothers. Hold the line.” They sat still, as 
 best they could, anyway. Able tapped his foot against the floor mat. Toddy was
 exhaling deep breaths. Gorman stared at the floor, meditative, like a monk. 
 Samuel stared at the radio.

 [Fuck, they got an MG. Jacobs was tagged. Fuck, fuck!]

 [Help is on the way, 09. All units, is anyone available? 06, what’s your 20?]

 [Dispatch, this is 06. We’re, uh, stuck in traffic on the turnpike. We’re 
 maybe thirty minutes out.]

 [Copy that, 06. 13, what’s your 20?]

 The fear in 09’s voice was palpable. Samuel shook his head in disbelief, and 
 finally broke, crying “Jesus Christ, guys! We’re right fucking here. Let’s 
 call it in.”

 “Hold the line, Sam,” Gorman replied in a rising tone of warning. “Don’t you 
 dare touch that radio.”

 Samuel thrust in his seat and turned to face the back, looking Gorman in the 
 eye through his mask, and cried “What if it was us?”

 “It’s going to be us if you call it in,” Toddy replied. “But at least turn the
 radio off. I don’t want to listen to this shit.”

 “No!” Gorman burst out, breaking his meditative state. “You guys need to hear 
 what happens when you turn on your brothers.”

 [We’re gonna’ fucking die, man! We’re gon- Jacobs! Jacobs! Are you- Jacobs? 
 No! Jacobs! Oh, fucking goddamnit, no! Hang in there, buddy. They’ll come. 
 They’ll come.]

 [Stay strong, 09! Help’s coming! 13, for fuck’s sake, answer, what’s your 20?]

 “Fuck this, I’m calling it,” Samuel declared, and grabbed the radio. Gorman 
 quickly unholstered his sidearm, racked it, and pressed it against Samuel’s 
 head.

 “What, are you gonna’ shoot me, Gorman? Go ahead, you fucking coward!”

 Able shifted in his seat, facing them both, trying to calm them with his hands.
 “Gorman! Easy! Easy! Gorman!”

 The radio receiver beeped when Samuel pressed its button. “Dispatch, this is 
 08-“

 A blinding flash, then a deafening gun report rocked the interior of the APC.
 Blood splattered against the dash and the passenger window, imperceptible on 
 the outside because of the dark tint. Samuel, dead, was still clutching the 
 radio. Able, his own mask covered with blood, shook violently, hands still 
 up, trapped in his futile calming pose. Toddy was cowering in the back seat.
 Gorman leaned forward, pushed Able, in shock, back into his seat, and grabbed
 the radio out of Samuel’s hand. He then raised it to his face as pressed the 
 button.

 [Dispatch, this is 08. We got a sniper on the corner of 5th and Lexington. 
 They got Samuel. We need help.]

 [08, this is 06. Enroute, we’re 10 minutes out.]

 [06, this is 13. Standby. We’re 3 minutes out. We’re coming 08, hang tight.]

 [Dispatch to… fuck… 09, are you there? 09? 09, please respond. 09…]
